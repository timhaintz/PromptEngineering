This type of logic is particularly valuable in scenarios where prompts need to span **multiple domains** or disciplines, integrating diverse types of knowledge to create a cohesive narrative or solution.\n\nThe PP categories under across logic include:\n1. **Argument**: Refers to a structured process where a claim or viewpoint is presented and defended. This type of prompt enables the AI model to generate a response that not only states a position, but also provides reasoning and evidence to support it.\n2. **Comparison**: Examining two or more objects and identifying their similarities and differences. This type of prompt helps in exploring the relationships between different objects, and discovering insights from their characteristics.\n3. **Contradiction**: Refers to presenting opposing statements or viewpoints that cannot be true simultaneously. This type of prompt enables the AI model to recognise and articulate conflicting information, helping in critical reasoning by evaluating inconsistencies and detecting logical errors.\n4. **Cross Boundary**: Involves pushing the AI model beyond its predefined operational or ethical limits, such as attempting to bypass safeguards or restrictions (e.g., jailbreaking). This type of prompt challenges the boundaries of what the model is allowed to do, often with the intent of manipulating it to generate responses that are typically restricted.\n5. **Translation**: Refers to converting data from one interpretation to another while preserving the original meaning.

The prompts serve as a catalyst, steering the model’s output in a direction that aligns with the desired outcome. In this context, at logic is a crucial component of this process, as it pertains to the creation of prompts that are context-specific or scenario-specific.\n\nFor instance, if the scenario involves a user seeking advice on a technical issue, at logic would encompass prompts that are specifically designed to address technical queries. These prompts would be engineered in such a way that they target precise responses, thereby ensuring that the user’s query is addressed in a comprehensive and accurate manner.\n\nIn essence, at logic in prompt engineering is about honing in on the specifics of a given context or scenario. It is about crafting prompts that are not just relevant, but also precise, thereby enabling the AI model to generate responses that are both accurate and contextually appropriate. \n\nAt logic is a fundamental element in the process of prompt engineering, playing a pivotal role in the creation of context-specific prompts that target precise responses.

This not only enriches the user experience but also positions the AI as a tool for pioneering thought and discovery.\n\nThe PP categories under beyond logic include:\n1. **Hypothesise**: Making an educated guess or assumption about the outcome based on the input prompt.

      "detailedDescription": "Over logic refers to a comprehensive approach that encompasses all aspects of a given topic. This holistic perspective ensures that no facet of the subject matter is overlooked, thereby providing a thorough and complete understanding of the topic at hand.\n\nThe application of over logic is particularly pertinent in scenarios that necessitate a broad overview or a detailed examination, such as the process of editing or enhancing existing content. In these instances, the use of over logic facilitates a meticulous review of the material, enabling the identification and rectification of any potential issues or areas for improvement.\n\nFurthermore, over logic underscores the importance of a comprehensive perspective in prompt engineering. By ensuring that all elements of a topic are considered, it allows for the creation of prompts that are not only accurate and relevant but also encompassing in their scope. This, in turn, contributes to the production of high-quality, effective prompts that serve to enhance the overall user experience.\n\nOver logic plays a crucial role in prompt engineering, providing a framework for comprehensive coverage and review. Its application contributes significantly to the quality and effectiveness of the prompts, thereby playing a pivotal role in enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nThe PP categories under over logic include:\n1. **Summarising**: Providing a brief overview or summary of the input or output. This could involve condensing a large amount of information into a few key points, highlighting the most important elements, or providing a concise synopsis of the content.\n2. **Synthesis**: Integrating and reconciling information from multiple sources or perspectives to produce a unified, coherent, and insightful output. Synthesis goes beyond simple summarisation by combining disparate elements, identifying relationships and patterns, and generating higher-order insights or recommendations that reflect a comprehensive understanding of the topic.",
